## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to add effect on the parent once the child is hovered.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<span class="title">HTML & CSS foundations</span>
```
```css
main:has(.title:hover){
    box-shadow: 20px 20px;
    transition: 0.1s;
}
